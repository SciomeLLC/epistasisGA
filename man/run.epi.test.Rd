\title{A function to run a test of the null hypothesis that a collection of SNPs do not exhibit epistasis, conditional
upon the observed marginal associations.}
\usage{
run.epi.test(
  snp.cols,
  preprocessed.list,
  n.permutes = 1000,
  n.different.snps.weight = 2,
  n.both.one.weight = 1,
  weight.function.int = 2,
  n.case.high.risk.thresh = 20,
  outlier.sd = 2.5,
  bp.param = bpparam()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{snp.cols}{An integer vector specifying the columns in the input data containing the SNPs to be tested.}

\item{preprocessed.list}{The initial list produced by function \code{preprocess.genetic.data}.}

\item{n.permutes}{The number of permutations on which to base the test. Defaults to 1000.}

\item{n.different.snps.weight}{The number by which the number of different SNPs between a case and complement or unaffected sibling
is multiplied in computing the family weights. Defaults to 2.}

\item{n.both.one.weight}{The number by which the number of SNPs equal to 1 in both the case and complement or unaffected sibling
is multiplied in computing the family weights. Defaults to 1.}

\item{weight.function.int}{An integer used to assign family weights. Specifically, we use \code{weight.function.int} in a function that takes the weighted sum
of the number of different SNPs and SNPs both equal to one as an argument, denoted as x, and
returns a family weight equal to \code{weight.function.int}^x. Defaults to 2.}

\item{n.case.high.risk.thresh}{The number of cases with the provisional high risk set required to check for recessive patterns of allele inheritance.}

\item{outlier.sd}{The number of standard deviations from the mean allele count used to determine whether recessive allele coding is appropriate
for a given SNP. See the GADGET paper for specific details on the implementation of this argument.}

\item{bp.param}{The BPPARAM argument to be passed to bplapply when estimating marginal disease associations for each SNP.
If using a cluster computer, this parameter needs to be set with care. See \code{BiocParallel::bplapply} for more details}
}
\value{
A list of thee elements:
\describe{
 \item{pval}{The p-value of the test.}
 \item{obs.fitness.score}{The fitness score from the observed data}
 \item{perm.fitness.scores}{A vector of fitness scores for the permuted datasets.}
}
}
\description{
This function runs a permutation based test of the null hypothesis that a collection of SNPs do not exhibit epistasis,
conditional upon the observed marginal associations.

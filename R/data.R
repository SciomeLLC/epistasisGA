#' SNP counts for the mothers of case-parent triads.
#'
#' A simulated dataset containing the counts of the alternate allele
#' for 100 SNPs for the mothers in 1000 simulated case-parent
#' triads. Columns represent SNPs, rows are individuals. SNPs
#' in columns 51, 52, 76, and 77 represent a true risk pathway.
